Raspberry Radio / Enigma Vu - Remote control
==========================================

A simple remote Control for a Radio Project on 
Raspberry PI, works so far and the VU+ Solo Satellite Receiver. 
Obviously you need to install the Raspberry project
to use all parts of this app, control of Vu+ should work
without additional hardware / software.

Controls
Middle Button long press: switch between control of 
VU and Raspberry internet Radio

Raspberry Mode:
----------------------------------------------

additional information which comes from the internet 
radio station.

The middle button selects a station.

Lower Button in Main Menu: Switch to Volume control
![Radio Volume](resources/screenshots/color/radioVolume.png)

Control the Volume, up/down middle button goes back 

Vu+ Mode:
----------------------------------------------
On the main window you see the two controls up (station)
and down (volume). 

The middle button (short press) is power off and power on.

Controlling of Station and volume is according to the control of
the internet radio. The difference is that you see no response on
your watch because you see the reaction on your television.


Acceleration Sensor  
------------------------------------
If you choose acceleration sensor in config, you can
control the movement of volume and station by turning
your wrist. Turn forward means down, backwards is up.
This is somewhat experimental ...
