Raspberry Radio / Enigma Vu - Remote control
==========================================

A simple remote Control for a Radio Project on 
Raspberry PI, experimental phase of developement,
in the moment nothing is working, so be patient :-)

You can also control an Enigma VU sat box.
(This project is a further developement of
the enigma vu project)

Controls
Left / Back - go back one level. 

Upper Button: Switch to station mode. You can 
scroll through the list of stations with up and 
down buttons on the Vu+ Solo you can see the reaction 
on your televisions screen

  
Middle / Select Button switch to Program if 
your are in station mode.

Lower Button. Switch to  Volume mode.
With the up/down Buttons you can control the Volume.
Middle Button leaves this mode (back button also leaves).

If you choose acceleration sensor in config, you can
control the movement of volume and station by turning
your wrist. Turn forward means down, backwards is up.
This is somewhat experimental ...
 
If you are not in Volume or station mode a long press
to the select button (middle right) switch between enigmavu 
control and raspio.
