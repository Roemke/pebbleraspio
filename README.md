Raspberry Radio - Remote control
==========================================

A simple remote Control for a Radio Project on 
Raspberry PI, experimental phase of developement,
in the moment nothing is working, so be patient :-)


Left / Back - go back one level. 

Upper Button: Switch to station mode. You can 
scroll through the list of stations with up and 
down buttons
  
Middle / Select Button switch to Program if 
your are in station mode.

Lower Button. Switch to  Volume mode.
With the up/down Buttons you can control the Volume.
Middle Button leaves this mode (back button also leaves).

If you choose acceleration sensor in config, you can
control the movement of volume and station by turning
your wrist. Turn forward means down, backwards is up.
This is somewhat experimental ...
 
The enigmavu control is integrated cause I use both

If you are not in Volume or station mode a long press
to the lower right button switch between enigmavu 
control and raspio.
