Raspberry Radio / Enigma Vu - Remote control
==========================================

A simple remote Control for a Radio Project on 
Raspberry PI, works so far and the VU+ Solo Satellite Receiver. 
Obviously you need to install the Raspberry project
to use all parts of this app, control of Vu+ should work
without additional hardware / software.
