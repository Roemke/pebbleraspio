Raspberry Radio - Remote control
==========================================

A simple remote Control for a Radio Project on 
Raspberry PI


Left / Back - go back one level. 

Upper Button: Sends Program Up  
Middle / Select Button switch to Program
Middle Button / Select: If your are not in Arrow Mode or
in Volume Mode, this sends the power on/off signal to
the receiver.

Lower Button. Sends Volume down to receiver.
With the up/down Buttons you can control the Volume.
Middle Button leaves this mode (back button also leaves).

If you choose acceleration sensor in config, you can
control the movement of volume and station by turning
your wrist. Turn forward means down, backwards is up.
This is somewhat experimental ...
 
The enigmavu control is integrated cause I use both
